These dotfiles sync between a personal MacOS laptop and Ubuntu server triggered by a script on opening a login shell. This repo contains config files (for nvim, tmux, zsh, ssh, git, yabai, skhd, sketchybar, and ghostty), which have package dependencies installable via the nix flake in the [dotfile-deps](https://www.github.com/kevwjin/dotfile-deps) repo.
